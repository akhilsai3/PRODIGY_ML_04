This project implements a hand gesture recognition model capable of accurately identifying and classifying various hand gestures from image or video data. The model facilitates intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems by leveraging computer vision techniques. It includes data preprocessing, deep learning model development (e.g., CNNs or RNNs), and evaluation metrics to measure classification accuracy. The repository contains directories for dataset storage, model training scripts, and examples for deployment. Required libraries include TensorFlow, OpenCV, and numpy for efficient implementation.
